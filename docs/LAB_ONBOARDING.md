# (edit files in your editor)

# 3. Test your changes
snakemake --use-conda -n  # dry run

# 4. Commit your work (frequently!)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new QC rule for X"

# 5. Push to your branch
git push origin feature/add-something
```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Pull requests" ‚Üí "New pull request"
3. Fill out the template:
   - What did you change?
