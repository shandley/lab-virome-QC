## Repository Settings

### General Settings

1. **Navigate to Settings** (must have admin access)
   - Go to: https://github.com/shandley/lab-virome-QC/settings

2. **Features to Enable:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Issues
   ‚úÖ Projects
   ‚úÖ Wiki (optional - for detailed documentation)
   ‚úÖ Discussions (optional - for community Q&A)
   ‚ùå Sponsorships (probably not needed)
   ```

3. **Pull Requests Settings:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Allow squash merging (recommended - keeps history clean)
   ‚úÖ Allow merge commits
   ‚ùå Allow rebase merging (can cause confusion for beginners)
   ‚úÖ Automatically delete head branches (keeps branches clean)
   ‚úÖ Allow auto-merge
   ```

4. **Default Branch:**
   - Ensure `main` is the default branch

---

## Branch Protection Rules

**Critical for preventing accidental changes to main!**

### Setting Up Branch Protection

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule**

2. **Branch name pattern:** `main`

3. **Enable these protections:**

```
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   ‚úÖ Require approvals (set to 1)
   ‚úÖ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   ‚ùå Require review from Code Owners (optional, for larger teams)

‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   Status checks to require:
      - linting
      - dry-run
      - validation

‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging

‚úÖ Require linear history (optional - enforces clean history)

‚ùå Require deployments to succeed (not needed for this project)

‚úÖ Lock branch (only for releases, not main)

‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
   - Admins can bypass (useful for emergencies)
   - Enforce for administrators (recommended after initial setup)

‚úÖ Restrict who can push to matching branches
   - Add: Lab members who should have write access
```

### Why These Protections Matter

| Protection | Why It Helps |
|------------|--------------|
| **Require PR** | Prevents direct commits to main; forces code review |
| **Require approvals** | Ensures someone else reviews your code |
| **Status checks** | Automated testing before merge (catches errors) |
| **Conversation resolution** | Ensures all feedback is addressed |
| **Up to date** | Prevents merge conflicts |

---

## Team Management

### Creating a GitHub Team

1. **Organization Required:**
   - Individual accounts can't create teams
   - Consider creating a GitHub Organization for the lab
   - Free for public repos: https://github.com/organizations/plan

2. **If Using Organization:**

   **Create team:**
   ```
   Organization Settings ‚Üí Teams ‚Üí New team

   Team name: virome-qc-team
   Description: Lab Virome QC Pipeline developers
   Visibility: Visible (lab members can see)
   ```

   **Add team members:**
   ```
   Members tab ‚Üí Add member

   Roles:
   - Maintainer: PI, senior lab members (can manage team)
   - Member: Everyone else (can contribute)
   ```

3. **If Using Individual Repo (Current Setup):**

   **Add collaborators:**
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Collaborators ‚Üí Add people

   Permissions:
   - Admin: PI only
   - Write: All lab members
   - Read: External collaborators (if any)
   ```

### Recommended Roles

| Person | Role | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Scott Handley (PI)** | Admin | Final approval, settings management |
| **Senior lab member** | Admin or Write | Help with code review, mentorship |
| **Bioinformatician** | Write | Primary development, review PRs |
| **Lab members** | Write | Contribute features, fixes |
| **Rotation students** | Write | Contribute with oversight |
| **External collaborators** | Read | Can view, clone, but not push |

## GitHub Actions Setup

**Already configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**

### What the CI Does

1. **Linting** - Checks code style
2. **Dry-run** - Validates Snakemake syntax
3. **Validation** - Checks YAML files, required files
4. **Documentation** - Checks markdown links

### Viewing CI Results

- Go to: Actions tab in GitHub
- See status of each workflow run
- Red ‚ùå = failed, Green ‚úÖ = passed

### Required Status Checks

Configure in Branch Protection (see above):
- `linting`
- `dry-run`
- `validation`

This prevents merging if tests fail!

---

## Project Boards

**Use GitHub Projects for task management**

### Creating a Project Board

1. **Go to Projects tab ‚Üí New project**

2. **Choose template:**
   - **Team backlog** (recommended)
   - **Feature** (for specific features)
   - **Bug triage** (for bug tracking)

3. **Recommended Setup:**

   **Board name:** `Lab Virome QC Development`

   **Columns:**
   ```
   üìã Backlog       - Ideas, future tasks
   üéØ To Do         - Prioritized tasks
   üèÉ In Progress   - Currently working on
   üëÄ In Review     - PR submitted, needs review
   ‚úÖ Done          - Completed
   ```

4. **Using the Board:**

   - Convert issues to project cards
   - Drag cards between columns
   - Assign to team members
   - Set due dates for milestones

### Example Workflow

```
User creates issue (#42: Add primer trimming)
   ‚Üì
Moved to "To Do" column
   ‚Üì
Lab member picks it up ‚Üí "In Progress"
   ‚Üì
Creates PR ‚Üí "In Review"
   ‚Üì
PR approved & merged ‚Üí "Done"
   ‚Üì
Issue automatically closed
```

## Labels and Milestones

### Essential Labels

**Create these labels** (Settings ‚Üí Labels):

| Label | Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `bug` | #d73a4a | Something isn't working |
| `enhancement` | #a2eeef | New feature or request |
| `documentation` | #0075ca | Documentation improvements |
| `good first issue` | #7057ff | Good for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | #008672 | Extra attention needed |
| `question` | #d876e3 | Further information requested |
| `wontfix` | #ffffff | This will not be worked on |
| `duplicate` | #cfd3d7 | Duplicate issue |
| `priority: high` | #ff0000 | Urgent |
| `priority: medium` | #ffaa00 | Normal priority |
| `priority: low` | #00ff00 | Can wait |
| `status: blocked` | #b60205 | Waiting on something |
| `status: in-progress` | #fbca04 | Currently being worked on |

### Creating Milestones

**For planning releases/phases:**

```
Settings ‚Üí Milestones ‚Üí New milestone

Examples:
- v1.0 - Initial Release (Target: 2025-02-01)
- Phase 1 - Basic QC Pipeline (Target: 2025-01-15)
- Phase 2 - Advanced Features (Target: 2025-03-01)
```

**Link issues to milestones:**
- Helps track progress toward goals
- Shows % completion
- Good for lab meeting updates

## Notifications

### Configuring Notifications

**Personal Settings:**
```
GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notifications

Recommended settings:
‚úÖ Email notifications for: Participating and @mentions
‚úÖ Web notifications for: Everything
‚úÖ Watching: Automatic watching for repositories you contribute to
```

### Watch Settings for This Repo

```
Repository ‚Üí Watch button (top right)

Options:
- All Activity (recommended for core team)
- Participating and @mentions (for occasional contributors)
- Ignore (not recommended)

Customize:
‚úÖ Issues
‚úÖ Pull Requests
‚úÖ Releases
‚ùå Discussions (unless you want)
```

### Managing Notification Overload

**Tips:**
1. Use email filters (Gmail rule: `to:lab-virome-QC`)
2. Check notifications once or twice a day
3. Unsubscribe from threads you're not involved in
4. Use `@mentions` to get someone's attention
5. Set "Do Not Disturb" hours in GitHub settings

---

## Security Settings

### Required for Lab Compliance

1. **Enable Security Features:**
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Code security and analysis

   ‚úÖ Dependency graph
   ‚úÖ Dependabot alerts
   ‚úÖ Dependabot security updates
   ‚úÖ Secret scanning (if available)
   ```

2. **What This Does:**
   - Alerts you to vulnerable dependencies
   - Automatically creates PRs to update dependencies
   - Prevents accidental commit of secrets (passwords, keys)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I can't push to main"

‚úÖ **This is intentional!** Branch protection is working.

**Solution:** Create a branch and PR instead.

### "CI is failing but my code works locally"

**Check:**
1. Did you commit all files?
2. Are there YAML syntax errors?
3. Check the Actions tab for specific error

### "I accidentally committed to main"

**Don't panic!**
```bash
# If you haven't pushed:
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# If you have pushed (and have permission):
git revert HEAD
git push
```

**Then:** Create proper PR next time!

### "Merge conflicts!"

```bash
# Update your branch with main
git checkout your-branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Resolve conflicts in files
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push
```
