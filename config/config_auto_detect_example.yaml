# =============================================================================
# Lab Virome QC Pipeline Configuration - Auto Sample Detection Example
# =============================================================================
# This configuration demonstrates automatic sample detection from a directory

# Output directory
output_dir: "results"

# Quality filtering parameters
quality_threshold: 20  # Phred quality score (Q20 = 99% accuracy)
min_read_length: 100   # Minimum read length after trimming (higher for library prep artifacts)

# Reference databases
references:
  # PhiX174 reference genome (Illumina sequencing control)
  phix: "resources/phix174.fasta"

  # Host genome for depletion
  # Replace with your host organism (human, mouse, etc.)
  host_genome: "resources/host_genome.fasta"

  # rRNA database - should include both SSU (16S/18S) and LSU (23S/28S)
  # Note: SSU-only databases (common for 16S amplicon work) will not remove LSU rRNA
  # Recommended: SILVA SSURef + LSURef combined (see README for download instructions)

# Sample information - not used when auto-detection is enabled
samples: {}

# Auto sample detection (ENABLED)
# Automatically finds all paired-end samples in a directory
sample_auto_detection:
  enabled: true

  # Directory containing your fastq.gz files
  input_dir: "data/raw"

  # Glob patterns for paired-end reads
  # The '*' wildcard will match the sample name
  # Adjust these patterns to match your file naming convention
  r1_pattern: "*_R1.fastq.gz"
  r2_pattern: "*_R2.fastq.gz"

  # Common alternative patterns:
  # For Illumina default naming:
  #   r1_pattern: "*_R1_001.fastq.gz"
  #   r2_pattern: "*_R2_001.fastq.gz"
  #
  # For short form:
  #   r1_pattern: "*_1.fq.gz"
  #   r2_pattern: "*_2.fq.gz"
  #
  # For dot separator:
  #   r1_pattern: "*.R1.fastq.gz"
  #   r2_pattern: "*.R2.fastq.gz"

# QC thresholds for flagging problematic samples
qc_thresholds:
  min_enrichment_score: 10      # ViromeQC enrichment score
  max_host_percent: 10          # Maximum % host reads (VLP failure if exceeded)
  max_rrna_percent: 20          # Maximum % rRNA after removal
  min_final_reads: 100000       # Minimum reads after all QC
  max_duplication_rate: 80      # Maximum % duplication

# Computational resources
# Adjust based on your system
resources:
  default_threads: 8
  default_mem_mb: 16000
