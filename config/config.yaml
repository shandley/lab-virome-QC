min_read_length: 100   # Minimum read length after trimming (higher for library prep artifacts)

  # rRNA database - should include both SSU (16S/18S) and LSU (23S/28S)
  # Note: SSU-only databases (common for 16S amplicon work) will not remove LSU rRNA
  # Recommended: SILVA SSURef + LSURef combined (see README for download instructions)
