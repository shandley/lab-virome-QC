# Lab Virome QC Pipeline

A comprehensive quality control pipeline for VLP-enriched virome sequencing data generated from RdAB (Random displacement Amplification) protocol and Illumina NovaSeq sequencing.

---

## Overview

This Snakemake pipeline provides robust QC specifically designed for:

- **VLP (Virus-Like Particle) enriched samples**
- **RdAB amplification** (RT + Random priming + PCR)
- **Illumina NovaSeq sequencing** (2-channel chemistry)
- **Mechanical shearing or tagmentation-based** library prep

### Key Features

✅ **NovaSeq-specific QC** - PolyG tail removal (critical for 2-channel chemistry)
✅ **VLP enrichment assessment** - ViromeQC enrichment scoring
✅ **Comprehensive contamination removal** - PhiX, host, rRNA
✅ **Optical duplicate removal** - Illumina patterned flow cell artifacts
✅ **Automated QC flagging** - Pass/fail criteria for each sample
✅ **Rich reporting** - MultiQC dashboard with all metrics

## Pipeline Workflow

```
Raw Reads (NovaSeq FASTQ)
    ↓
[1] FastQC (raw reads)
    ↓
[2] Clumpify (remove optical duplicates)
    ↓
[3] fastp (CRITICAL: polyG removal + adapter trimming + QC)
    ↓
[4] FastQC (trimmed reads)
    ↓
[5] BBDuk (PhiX removal)
    ↓
[6] minimap2 (host depletion) ← QC metric for VLP success
    ↓
[7] BBDuk (rRNA removal)
    ↓
[8] ViromeQC (enrichment assessment) ← PRIMARY QC metric
    ↓
[9] FastQC (final clean reads)
    ↓
[10] MultiQC (aggregate all reports)
    ↓
Clean reads + QC reports + Sample flags
```

## Installation

### Requirements

- [Conda/Mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) (for environment management)
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) ≥7.0

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lab-virome-QC.git
cd lab-virome-QC

# Install Snakemake (if not already installed)
conda create -n snakemake -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake
conda activate snakemake

# Test installation
snakemake --version
```

---

## Setup

### 1. Prepare Reference Databases

Download required reference databases to `resources/`:

```bash
mkdir -p resources

# PhiX174 reference (Illumina control)
# Download from NCBI or use BBTools version
wget https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001422.1 -O resources/phix174.fasta

# Host genome (example: human GRCh38)
# Download from Ensembl, NCBI, or UCSC
# Example for human:
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
mv Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa resources/host_genome.fasta

# rRNA database (SILVA)
# Download from: https://www.arb-silva.de/no_cache/download/archive/
# Or use pre-built BBTools database:
wget https://drive5.com/uchime/uchime_download.html
# Place in resources/silva_rrna.fasta
```

### 2. Configure Sample Information

Edit `config/config.yaml` or create a sample sheet `config/samples.tsv`:

**Option A: Edit config.yaml directly**
```yaml
samples:
  sample1:
    r1: "data/raw/sample1_R1.fastq.gz"
    r2: "data/raw/sample1_R2.fastq.gz"
  sample2:
    r1: "data/raw/sample2_R1.fastq.gz"
    r2: "data/raw/sample2_R2.fastq.gz"
```

**Option B: Use sample sheet (recommended for many samples)**
```bash
# Edit config/samples.tsv
sample	r1	r2
sample1	data/raw/sample1_R1.fastq.gz	data/raw/sample1_R2.fastq.gz
sample2	data/raw/sample2_R1.fastq.gz	data/raw/sample2_R2.fastq.gz
```

### 3. Adjust QC Thresholds (Optional)

Edit `config/config.yaml` to set custom QC thresholds:

```yaml
qc_thresholds:
  min_enrichment_score: 10      # ViromeQC enrichment score
  max_host_percent: 10          # Maximum % host reads
  max_rrna_percent: 20          # Maximum % rRNA after removal
  min_final_reads: 100000       # Minimum reads after QC
```

---

## Usage

### Run Complete Pipeline

```bash
# Dry run (check what will be executed)
snakemake --use-conda -n

# Run locally with 8 cores
snakemake --use-conda --cores 8

# Run on HPC with SLURM
snakemake --use-conda --profile slurm --jobs 20
```

### Run Specific Steps

```bash
# Just run FastQC on raw reads
snakemake --use-conda --cores 4 results/fastqc/raw/

# Run up to adapter trimming
snakemake --use-conda --cores 8 results/fastp/

# Generate MultiQC report only
snakemake --use-conda --cores 2 results/multiqc/multiqc_report.html
```

### Generate DAG Visualization

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag.png
```

## Interpreting Results

### 1. MultiQC Report

Open `results/multiqc/multiqc_report.html` in a web browser.

**Key sections to check:**
- **FastQC**: Look for polyG in overrepresented sequences (should be gone after fastp)
- **fastp**: Check adapter content, insert size distribution, duplication rates
- **Read counts**: Track reads retained at each step

### 2. Sample QC Flags

Check `results/reports/sample_qc_flags.tsv`:

```
sample    enrichment_score  pass_enrichment  pass_host  pass_rrna  overall_pass  notes
sample1   25.3              PASS             PASS       PASS       PASS          None
sample2   3.2               FAIL             FAIL       PASS       FAIL          Low_enrichment(3.2);High_host(15.3%)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **PASS**: Sample meets all QC criteria
- **FAIL**: Sample fails one or more criteria (check notes)
- **WARNING**: Insufficient data to assess

### 3. ViromeQC Enrichment Score

**Most important QC metric for VLP samples!**

- **Score >>1 (e.g., >10)**: Good VLP enrichment
- **Score ~1**: Poor enrichment (essentially a metagenome)
- **Score <1**: VLP prep failed

Low scores indicate:
- Failed VLP preparation
- Excessive bacterial contamination
- Sample may need to be excluded or re-processed

### 4. Host Contamination

Check `results/host_depleted/*_host_stats.txt`

- **<5% host reads**: Excellent VLP prep
- **5-10% host**: Acceptable
- **>10% host**: VLP prep likely failed

### 5. Read Retention

Check `results/reports/read_counts.tsv`

Typical read retention through QC pipeline:
```
Raw → Clean: 20-50% retention is normal for VLP samples
```

Major losses expected at:
- fastp (adapter trimming, polyG, quality)
- rRNA removal (if RT-based protocol)

## Critical NovaSeq + VLP Considerations

### PolyG Tails (NovaSeq Artifact)

**Problem:** NovaSeq 2-channel chemistry calls dark cycles as high-quality G bases
**Solution:** fastp with `--trim_poly_g` (enabled by default in this pipeline)
**Check:** FastQC on raw reads should show GGGG in overrepresented sequences; should be gone after fastp

### VLP Enrichment Assessment

**Problem:** VLP prep can fail, resulting in metagenome-like contamination
**Solution:** ViromeQC quantifies enrichment score
**Action:** Flag samples with enrichment score <10 for review/exclusion

### Host Contamination as QC Metric

**Problem:** High host reads indicate VLP prep failure
**Solution:** Track % host reads; flag >10%
**Note:** Unlike metagenome QC, host contamination is QC failure, not just data cleanup

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline fails at ViromeQC

**Error:** `viromeQC.py: command not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install ViromeQC manually
conda activate viromeqc
pip install viromeqc
```

### High memory usage

**Problem:** BBTools rules consuming too much RAM

**Solution:** Reduce memory allocation in Snakefile:
```python
resources:
    mem_mb = 8000  # Reduce from 16000
```

### Pipeline is slow

**Problem:** Single-threaded execution

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use more cores
snakemake --use-conda --cores 16

# Or run on cluster
snakemake --use-conda --cluster "sbatch" --jobs 50
```

### Adapter sequences not removed

**Problem:** Custom primers not detected by fastp

**Solution:** Add custom adapter sequences to fastp rule:
```bash
--adapter_sequence CUSTOM_PRIMER_B_SEQ \
--adapter_sequence_r2 CUSTOM_PRIMER_B_R2_SEQ
```
